## Hi, there ðŸ‘‹

I am Donghyeok Tak, a master's student in computer science at [ICON Lab](https://icon.kw.ac.kr) @ Kwangwoon University.

## Interests

I'm interested in machine learning, neuromorphic systems based on spiking neural networks, distributed and intermittent computing, and autonomous driving.

But I also enjoy everything related to computers!
