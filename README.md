## Hi, there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Donghyeok Tak, majoring in software and working as an undergraduate researcher at [ICON Lab](https://icon.kw.ac.kr) @ Kwangwoon University.

## Interests

I'm interested in linear algebra, machine learning, and neuromorphic systems based on spiking neural networks.
In particular, my research area includes SSMs, SNNs, and Transformers.

But I also enjoy everything related to computers! Here are some examples:
- Wireless Communication
- Autonomous Driving
- Building beautiful applications using flutter
