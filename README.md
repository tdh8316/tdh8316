## Hi, there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Donghyeok Tak, majoring in software and working as an undergraduate researcher at Kwangwoon University.

## Interests

I'm interested in machine learning and neuromorphic systems based on spiking neural networks.

But in fact, I'm interested in everything computers can do! Here are some examples:

- Building beautiful applications using flutter
- Wireless communication and SDR
- Programming language theory
